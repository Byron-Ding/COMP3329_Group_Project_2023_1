## 2. Game introduction
RESCUE HKU is a PvE game with the background of a virtual world built on the University of Hong Kong. In 2033, an evil AI named CSatan controls all professors in the CS department and creates evil elves. Players in this game need to portray a CS student named Jack and their goal is to defeat evil elves and save professors from the power of evil, and ultimately beat AI CSatan, shut it down and bring light back to the University of Hong Kong.

## 3. Feature scope
We have implemented roughly four main features, battle system, inventory system, elf system and Npc. And we have built three chapters currently.

First, we put a lot of effort into building the battle system. It consists of Player Unit on the left, Enemy Unit on the right and DialogBox below. Both units have the picture of elves and an information module to display the name, level, HP, exp of their elves. DialogBox achieves a lot of functions. It can show dialogs and feedback with a smooth typing mode. Plus, it gets an action selection module on the right, which means the player can choose to Fight, Run, change elves and capture enemy elves. When the player chooses to fight, the dialogBox will show at most four skills and each of them has type and pp(the number can be used).

Then, in the inventory system, we can buy and sell items, and we can also use these items when we battle with enemy elves. In the elf system, we have designed roughly nine different elves, each of them has four skills. As the level of the elf increases, it can learn stronger skills. In the Npc system, players can communicate with the npc and get information about the storyline and get instructions.

A total of 3 chapters have been implemented. Each chapter gets their own background music and map style. Whatâ€™s more, each chapter has their unique elves group, which is two basic elves and one boss.

## Have a great time!!!
